# Future-School-Budgets-and-Priorities
Analyzing future school budgets and priorities with Pandas


## Introduction ##
I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I have access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## District Summary ##
Performed the necessary calculations and created a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
* Total number of unique schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## School Summary ##
Performed the necessary calculations and created a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
